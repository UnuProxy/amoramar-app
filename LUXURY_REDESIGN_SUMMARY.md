## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Color Consistency**: The new luxury palette is applied via Tailwind config, so all existing color classes will automatically use the new colors.

2. **Brand Identity**: Consider updating the logo and imagery to match the new luxury Ibiza aesthetic.

3. **Typography**: The current bold, uppercase style works well with the luxury theme. Consider adding a serif font for headings if desired.

4. **Images**: Update hero images and service photos to reflect the Ibiza luxury vibe (Mediterranean, elegant, spa-like).
